  ## Installation:
  Once you have the repo code downloaded you can open up VS code and create the database in Workbench with the schema provided. Once you can see that the database is there you need to create tables so that you can seed the data that is given. Now run the code: npm i, to install the packages that were used in this project. Then we will run the code node seeds/index.js to seed the database so we can manipulate the data provided. Now in the integrated terminal in VS code we can start up the server so I will run the code: nodemon server.js or you can run the code node server.js, now you can work in insomnia where it can demonstrate the api routes.
